# 🚀 Sentinel Copilot Agent
> 🏆 Hackathon Submission – Microsoft Agent Academy

### AI-Powered Governance for Power Platform

Sentinel Copilot Agent is an intelligent, enterprise-grade governance system that transforms how organizations monitor, analyze, and interact with Power Platform assets.

It combines **Copilot Studio**, **Power Automate**, **Azure OpenAI**, and **Azure Functions** to deliver **autonomous, AI-driven governance with conversational insights**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

As Power Platform adoption scales, governance becomes a critical challenge:

- ❌ Limited visibility into flows and their behavior  
- ❌ Security risks (hardcoded secrets, external calls)  
- ❌ Missing retry, error handling, and resilience patterns  
- ❌ Manual, time-consuming audits  
- ❌ No simple way to query governance insights  

👉 Result: **Operational risk, compliance gaps, and production failures**

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

Sentinel introduces a **hybrid AI + rule-based governance model**:

### ✅ What it does:

- Automatically discovers Power Automate flows  
- Analyzes flow definitions using **Azure OpenAI (semantic AI)**  
- Performs structural validation via **Azure Function (AST-style analysis)**  
- Stores insights in structured format (SharePoint)  
- Enables natural language interaction via **Copilot Studio**  

---

## 🧠 Key Innovation

### 🔥 Hybrid Intelligence Model

| Layer | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Azure OpenAI | Semantic risk detection |
| Azure Function (AST) | Structural validation |
| Power Automate | Orchestration |
| Copilot Studio | Conversational interface |

👉 This combination ensures **both depth and accuracy**, unlike traditional governance tools.

👉 Additionally, Sentinel optimizes AI usage by reducing token consumption through AST-based preprocessing, enabling cost-efficient and scalable deployments.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

![Architecture](./docs/architecture/sentinel-architecture.png)

Sentinel follows a **layered enterprise architecture** designed for scalable, AI-powered governance of Power Platform solutions.

---

### 🔹 1. User Interaction Layer
- **Sentinel Copilot Agent (Copilot Studio)**
- Provides a conversational interface for users to interact with governance insights
- Accepts natural language queries and initiates downstream processing

---

### 🔹 2. Query Layer
- **Copilot Query Flow (`snl_fl_Copilot_QueryFlows`)**
- Interprets user intent from Copilot
- Retrieves governance insights from the data layer
- Formats and returns responses back to the Copilot agent

---

### 🔹 3. Data Layer
- **Sentinel Flows (SharePoint List)**  
  Stores:
  - Flow metadata  
  - Flow Definition JSON  
  - Processing status  

- **Sentinel Results (SharePoint List)**  
  Stores:
  - Risk scores and levels  
  - Issue summaries  
  - Governance insights (AI + AST results)  

---

### 🔹 4. Processing Layer
- **Collector Flow (`snl_fl_Collector_DiscoverFlows`)**
  - Uses Power Automate Management API to discover flows
  - Extracts and stores metadata in Sentinel Flows  

- **Intelligence Flow (`snl_fl_Intelligence_AnalyzeFlow`)**
  - Orchestrates analysis pipeline
  - Sends flow definitions to:
    - Azure OpenAI (semantic analysis)
    - Azure Function (AST-based structural analysis)
  - Stores enriched results in Sentinel Results  

---

### 🔹 5. Service Layer

---

✅ This layered architecture enables a **hybrid governance model** combining:
- AI-driven semantic understanding  
- Rule-based structural validation  
- Automated data collection and orchestration  
- Conversational user experience via Copilot  


---

- Generate human-readable explanations  

👉 Config details:  
`./docs/ai/openai-usage.md`

---

## 💰 Token Optimization & Cost Efficiency

Sentinel is designed with a strong focus on **efficient AI usage and cost optimization**.

### 🔹 Problem

Directly sending full Power Automate flow definitions to large language models can result in:

- High token consumption  
- Increased operational cost  
- Performance overhead  
- Unnecessary exposure of sensitive data  

---

### 🔹 Solution: AST-Based Preprocessing

Sentinel introduces an **Azure Function (SentinelSanitizer)** that performs:

- Structural parsing (AST-style analysis)  
- Extraction of relevant components  
- Filtering of unnecessary or sensitive data  

✅ Only **essential, sanitized inputs** are sent to Azure OpenAI  

---

### 🔹 Benefits

- ✅ **Reduced token consumption** (smaller, focused payloads)  
- ✅ **Lower AI costs**  
- ✅ **Improved response accuracy** (less noise)  
- ✅ **Faster processing time**  
- ✅ **Enhanced security** (sensitive data filtered out)  

---

### 🔹 Hybrid Processing Strategy

| Stage | Responsibility |
|------|--------------|
| Azure Function | Filter, sanitize, extract structure |
| Azure OpenAI | Semantic understanding and explanation |

👉 This ensures AI is used **efficiently and responsibly**, making Sentinel viable for **enterprise-scale deployments**.


---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance (AST Protection Layer)

Sentinel is designed with enterprise-grade security and responsible AI principles.

### ✅ Sensitive Data Protection

- The Azure Function (`SentinelSanitizer`) acts as a **pre-processing layer**
- It performs AST-style analysis to:
  - Detect sensitive patterns (keys, URLs, secrets)
  - Sanitize or avoid sending sensitive data to AI models

### ✅ Controlled AI Exposure

- Only **necessary and sanitized inputs** are sent to Azure OpenAI  
- Prevents leakage of:
  - Credentials  
  - Internal endpoints  
  - Sensitive configurations  

### ✅ Compliance Alignment

This ensures alignment with:

- Enterprise security policies  
- Responsible AI usage  
- Data minimization principles  

👉 Sentinel implements a **“Analyze First, Send Later”** approach for safe AI integration.
